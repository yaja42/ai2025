      " Chapter One  THE BOY WHO WASNT UNALIVED  Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive liked flexing that they were very basic thank u Tbh they were the last people youd think would be sus because they were all fax no printer  Mr Dursley was adulting at a firm called Grunnings which made drills  He was a dummy thiccc w three Cs man with hardly any neck although he had an absolute unit of a mustache Mrs Dursley was a total Karen with zero chill and had hella neck which came in very useful when she was stalking her neighbours and not minding her own  The Dursleys had a future incel of a son named Dudley who they thought was the main character The Dursleys were mostly thriving but they also had lowkey tea which didnt pass the vibe check and their greatest fear was to get called out and cancelled They were girlbossing too close to the sun and didnt think their clout could bounce back if their fam the Potters were revealed Milf Lily Potter was Mrs Dursleys sis but Mrs D had gone ghost irl no cap Mrs D fronted she didnt have a sis because Lil and her deadbeat mans were straight up cringe If the neighbors ever peeped the Potters itd be a big yikes Lowkey the Dursleys knew the Potters had their own crotch goblin too but theyd never peeped This bb was fr a solid reason 2 keep the inlaws yote they didnt want Dudley mixing with a gross being like that  When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull gray fight me Tuesday our lore opens the cloudy overlay didnt vibe like strange and mysterious things would be happening all over the country Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley spilled the tea as she was tryna put a screaming Dudley into his heckin high chair  None of them noticed a chonky tawny owl flutter past the window  At half past eight the chonklord that is Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed because Dudley was losing it and yeeted his cereal at the walls Little Lad chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house He got into his whip and backed out into the driveway of their basic asf house  It was on that one edge of the street that you feel like you could accidentally hit the elbow of your car on that he noticed something sus a cat popping off and reading a map For a sec Mr Dursley didnt realize what hed seenthen he jerked his head around to look again There was a chonking tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive but there wasnt a map in sight What could he have been thinking of He must have accidentally picked up one of Mrs Dursleys edibles that morning Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the chonking cat It stared back As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the chonkers in his mirror It was now reading the sign that said Privet Driveno _looking_ at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs Periodt Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the chonkers out of his thinkingorgan As he drove toward the town he had no thonks head empty except for some drills he had to sell _Lets get this L O A F_ he thought  But on the edge of town drills were yeeted out of his mind by something else As he sat in the morning traffic jam starterpack he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of notveryshadyatall people about People in cloaks No cap Mr Dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in cheugy clothes  the getups you saw on young people He supposed this was some stupid new fashion He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by They were whispering excitedly together Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be a boomer and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak The audacity of him But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt a tiktok probs  these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor If he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning He didnt see the owls popping off in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed deceased as owl after owl sped overhead Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime Mr Dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning He had no chill and yelled at five different people He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more He was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery Hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the Starbucks He took a beeg look at them with unhappy as he passed He didnt know why but they seemed kinda sus This bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single GoFundMe donation tin It was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying The Potters thats right thats what I heard     bet their boi Harry   Mr Dursley felt like hed been ratioed irl He looked back at the whisperers and wondered if he should  them but thought better of it Even a girlboss has his weak moments and anyway there were plenty of people called Potter with moots called Harry There was no point in worrying his discord kitten her sister was on both their DNI lists  During that day emo thoughts kept dabbing across Mr Dursleys mind He later left the building and nearly sister slammed into someone just outside his door  Naurrr he grunted as the man nearly fell However he didnt seem triggered at all instead the funky little dude pressed the slay button So true bestie Even Muggles like u should slayy today when The Sussiest Of Bakas has been canceled at last  And then the old man hugged Mr Dursley real and headed off  Mr Dursley couldnt even find it in him to yeah fortnite 10k were about to go down babey He hurried to his car and The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drifted straight home  As he pulled into the driveway the first thing he sister saw was the same chonk cat hed seen in the morning sitting on the wall  POV Youre on my DNI list Mr Dursley spat at the cat as he walked inside  His girlypops day was swag asf Dudley had learned to say Naur Just like his bestie cooed Mrs Dursley When his fav oomf finally went afk Mr Dursley went to the living room to watch sum news Last thing birders everywhere are fighting for their lives right now Them hooters hunt at night and avoid sunlight like nerds but for some reason theyve been invading our skies since sunrise The science isnt scienceing The newscaster smirked Weird af bro Now Jim McGuffin what that weather do boyyyy Anymore owl showers tonight  Say less Ted said the weatherman Tbh idk but the birbs arent the only weird mullet daddies today Viewers as far apart as Kent Yorkshire and Dundee have been tweeting that instead of the rain I promised yesterday the sky is having shooting stars Maybe theyre celebrating Bonfire Night early It will actually rain tonight though but its about to be raining hands if mfs dont stop calling about these damn birds  Mr Dursley 404 errored in his armchair Shooting stars Owls waking up and choosing violence Sus boomers dressed in renfaire outfits And spilling tea bout the Potters  Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea It was no good Hed have to say something to her He cleared his throat nervously Er  Petunia my cotton swab  you havent heard from your sis of late maybe  As he had expected Mrs Dursley looked like she ate a lemon After all they ghosted her sis  Nope she said sharply Why  Cringey crap on the news Mr Dursley mumbled Owls shooting stars and there were a lot of edgelords in town today  And snapped Mrs Dursley  Well I just thought maybe it was something to do with  you know _her crew_  Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her that hed heard the name Potter He decided he didnt dare Instead he said as casually as he could Their crotch goblin  hed be about Dudleys age now wouldnt he  Probs huffed Mrs Dursley  Whats his name again Howard isnt it  Harry Nasty cringe name if you ask me  Oh yeah Mr Dursleys feels felt punched Legit  He decided to stfu as they finna upstairs to catch some zs While Mrs Dursley took off her face Mr Dursley lurked in the bedroom window overlooking the front garden The floof was still there It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something  Was he imagining things Could all this have anything to do with the Potters If it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of  they would totes be cancelled  The Dursleys got into bed Mrs Dursley crashed but Mr Dursley couldnt shake the intrusive thoughts Finally he comforted himself that if the Potters were involved there was no reason for them to invade the Dursleys space The Potters knew very well that he and his bae thought they were cringe and wanted nothing to do with their shenanigans He couldnt see how they could get all up in his business They were probs safe and outta the way  Hahahaha nope  Mr Dursley was drifting off uneasily but the floof outside was on high alert Like a fuzzy statue with penetrating eyes it stared unblinking at the far corner of Privet Drive It showed superb chill as the world happened around it  An ancient man appeared on the corner the cat had been protec on Privet Drive He was tall thin and very old with a boss beard long enough to tuck into his belt He was slaying in his long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots His blu eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his honker was long and crooked as though he had been punched in the face before This ya boi Albus Dumbledore  Albus Dumbledore was super chill about the fact that he wasnt wanted on this street He was busy doing a self body cavity search until he felt the gaze of the catto He chuckled and muttered I should have known  He found his query a silver cigarette lighter flicked it open and clicked it RIP the nearest street lamp Ya boi got click happy and plunged the street into darkness Now the nosy Nancy neighbors could see nothing on the block The old man waltzed down the street to chill with the cat  Sup Prof McGonagall  He turned to smile at the tabby who was now a human with the air of a CEO serious business woman She be wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings on the cat Her lewk was on fleek with an emerald green cloak and black hair in a tight bun  How did you know it was me she asked  Prof cats dont look like they planking  Brick walls arent comfy  Y u no party There are like a dozen dank bangers I passed getting here  Prof McGonagall sniffed angrily  Oh yes everyones celebrating all right Highkey Muggles noticed It was on their idiot box Flocks of birbs shooting stars Muggles have eyes Shooting stars down in Kent  bet that was Dedalus Diggle Smooth brain  You cant blame them Dumbledore cooed This bull has been like 2020 for eleven years  Bet said Prof McG irritably But thats no reason to lose our chill People be like herp derp strutting like peacocks in broad daylight not even dressed in Muggle swag sipping tea  She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on A fine thing it would be if on the very day YouKnowWho kicked rocks the Muggles found out about us all Did we really take a W  Bet said Dumbledore We have so much to be thankful for Wanna lemon drop  WTF  A lemon drop Muggle candy that is dank  Nope Prof McG initiated ice queen mode Even if YouKnowWho has stepped off  Girl names are a thing That trash is called Voldemort Prof McG flinched but homeboi was unsticking lemon drops and gave no fucks Chillax its just a name  Bet Prof McG was exasperated but eyeing Dumbldore like a snacc But youre the only one who could make Voldemort salty  Flattery will get you everywhere Voldemort did have moves though Dumbledore said calmly  Fr you do too but you dont flex  You make me blush  Prof McG shot Dumbledore a sharp look and said The birbs are nothing next to this tea they be sipping Legit what they say has me shook  Prof McG had obvi got to the tea she was most hyped to spill the real reason she had been vibing on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a floof nor as a woman had she looked as highkey invested as she did now It was obvi that whatever everyone was saying she wasnt gonna buy it until Dumbledore told her there was no cap Homeboi however was choosing another lemon drop and didnt answer  What theyre _saying_ she pressed on  is that last night Voldemort spawned in Godrics Hollow He went to find the Potters And that he unalived Lily and James Potter  Dumbledore sadded Prof McG gasped  Lily and James What the heck I cant even Oh Albus  Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder Im shook too  Professor McGonagalls voice was shook as she went on Thats not all They are saying he tried to unalive their son Harry Potter but he took an L and his power broke  and thats why hes gone  Dumbledore noddled glumly  Legit faltered Professor McGonagall After all hes done he failed to unalive a babin and shm how did Harry survive  We can only guess said Dumbledore We may never know  Prof McG wiped her eyes and got out her hand sanitizer Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a bussin watch from his pocket and checked it It was a very sus watch It had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said Hagrids late I bet hes the one who told you Id be here btw  Bet said Prof McG And I dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all places  Ive come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle Theyre the only fam he has left now  You dont mean  you cant mean these Karens cried Prof McG jumping to her feet and pointing at number four Dumbledore  you cant I have been watching them all day These basic fools arent in the Same WhatsApp group And their spawn  I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets Harry Potter come and live here  Cope Its the best place for him said Dumbledore firmly His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older Ive written them a letter  A _letter_ repeated Prof McG faintly sitting down on the wall Fr Dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter These people will never understand him Hell be famous  legendary  I wouldnt be shook if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future  there will be books written about Harry  every child in our world will know his name  Bet said Dumbledore looking super serious through his specs It would be enough to go to anyones head An influencer before he can walk and talk Famous for something he wont even remember Cant you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take it  Prof McG made fish faces like she was going to say something but thought better She composed herself then said Bet ikr But how is the boy getting here Dumbledore She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he was transporting the babin  Hagrids bringing him  You think it big brain to trust Hagrid with something as important as this  I would trust Hagrid with my life said Dumbledore  His heart is GOAT said Prof McG grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not an airhead He does tend to  what was that  A _vroom vroom_ sound broke the silence around them It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky  a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them  If the motorcycle was huge it was nothing compared to the beast of a man straddling it He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and had some major BDE big dick energy His fluffy factor was a Oh hell no and so wild  long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of hubcaps and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins In his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets  Hagrid said Dumbledore sounding relieved Finally Whered you get the ride  Borrowed it Professor Dumbledore sir said the giant gently disembarking from the bike Young Sirius Black lent it to me Ive got him sir  Any issues  Nope  house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin around He took a napper as we was flyin over Bristol  Dumbledore and Prof McG bent forward over the bundle of blankets Inside just visible was the babin sleepin Under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a sus af cut shaped like a bolt of lightning  Is that where whispered Prof McG  Bet said Dumbledore Hell have that scar forever  Cantcha fix it Dumbledore  Yeah but no Scars come in handy I have one on my knee that is totes a map of the London Underground Well  gimme Hagrid  lets get this over with  Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys house  Could I  could I say bye to him sir asked Hagrid He bent his great shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss Then suddenly Hagrid let out a noise like a wounded pupper  STFU hissed Prof McG youll wake the normies  Ssssowwy sobbed Hagrid taking out a large spotted handkercheif and burying his face in it But I cccant stand it  Lily an James unalived  an an poor lil Harry off ter live with Muggles   Yeah no yeah tragic but control yourself Hagrid or well be found Prof McG whispered patting Hagrid gently on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to the other two For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle Hagrids shoulders shook Prof McG blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out  Whelp said Dumbledore finally thats that Time to dip We may as well go party hearty  Yeah said Hagrid in a very muffled voice Finna give Sirius back his ride Gnight Prof McG  Professor Dumbledore sir  Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night  See ya soon G said Dumbledore nodding to her Prof McG blew her nose in reply  Dumbledore walked off into the night On the corner he stopped and took out the silver PutOuter He clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four  Gl Harry he murmured He spun on his heel swished his cloak and vanished into the night  A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive super basic even under the stars the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen Harry Potter cuddled up inside his blankies sleepin soundly One smol hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by Mrs Dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley He couldnt know that at this very moment peeps meeting in secret all over the county gettin lit and saying in hushed voices To Harry Potter  the boy who wasnt unalived\n"
